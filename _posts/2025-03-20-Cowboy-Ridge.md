# Cowboy Ridge: A Classic Adventure Outside Zion

Cowboy Ridge is a hidden gem just outside Zion National Park, offering a perfect blend of scrambling, route-finding, and jaw-dropping scenery. Our group set out early, eager to beat the heat and experience the ridge in solitude.

## The Approach

The day began with a brisk hike through desert brush, the sun rising over the mesas. We quickly gained elevation, the views expanding with every step. The ridge itself came into view, a serrated line of sandstone beckoning us upward.

## The Climb

The first pitch was a mellow scramble, but things quickly got interesting. Cooper took the lead on a steeper section, finding solid holds and weaving through blocks.

Jordan followed, moving smoothly up the exposed arete. The rock was surprisingly solid for the area, and the exposure made for an exhilarating experience.

## Summit Views

After four pitches and plenty of route-finding, we topped out on the ridge. The panorama was incredible—Zion's cliffs to the east, Pine Valley Mountains to the west, and endless desert in every direction. We took a long break, soaking in the silence and the sense of accomplishment.

## The Descent

The descent was a straightforward hike down a sandy gully, with a few fun downclimbs thrown in. We made it back to the trailhead in just under two hours, tired but grinning from ear to ear.

## Final Thoughts

Cowboy Ridge is a must-do for anyone looking for an adventurous day outside Zion. The combination of moderate climbing, big views, and solitude makes it a classic. Bring plenty of water, a good sense of direction, and a camera—you'll want to remember this one!
