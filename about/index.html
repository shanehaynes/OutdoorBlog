      <p>I grew up appreciating the wonders of the outdoors and receiving the lessons they could bestow.
         In winter we would spend most weekends skiing at our local resort Sundance and every summer my dad would take my twin brother and I on a week long
          backpacking trip, often to Uintas but occasionally to the Wind River Range. These trips are 
          likely where I learned that enjoyment is strongly correlated with effort. The deeper we pressed 
          into mountainous, empty places where our existence was dwindled beneath the majesty and grandeur 
          of nature, the more I fell in love with wildnerness. </p>

      <p>In adolescence, basketball pulled me away. Coaches warned against “injury-prone activities,” and my 
        schedule left little room for the backcountry. It wasn’t until college, when I took a job as an indoor 
        climbing instructor and route setter, that I returned. There I met people whose enthusiasm for adventure 
        was contagious. We filled hours at the climbing gym dreaming of the remote, the multi-disciplinary, the 
        consequential. I still enjoy all kinds of adventures, but I pursue them with an eye toward the next challenge 
        that is both polymathic and weighty.</p>

      <p>After each adventure of this kind, whether beaming from success or sulking from failure, I returned 
        changed. Endeavors of this sort are, inescapably, transformative. Their trials strip away illusion, 
        teaching humility in the face of forces beyond control. Their beauty awakens a reverence that is 
        part joy, part sorrow, as if one had glimpsed something eternal. The camaraderie forged in hardship lingers 
        long after, a reminder that solitude and fellowship are not opposites but companions in the wild. Above all, 
        these endeavors demand introspection: to confront oneself as much as the landscape, and to find, if only for a 
        moment, that the boundary between the two begins to blur.</p>

      <p>Hence, my pithy phrase for the motto of this blog:</p>

      <p><span style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; display: block">"No cathedral more sublime, No crucible more stern, Than the natural world." </span></p>
